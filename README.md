###### Factorio Mod ######

## Dynamic Custom Start ##
Instead of having to try and use the limited options of quick start mods available that aren't aware of other mods that add items to your game that you have running, this mod generates an Item Vault pop-up initially on player spawn where you can select items to add to your inventory to kick-start your game.

Note: How you play is your own business and which items and the amount of them (or stacks of them) that you add to your game is up to you. There are two limitations defined in settings. The max time (in minutes) that the Item Vault window will spawn (this was intended for multiplayer game integrity but is untested). The max amount of unique item selections you can make, in increments of 3 the current max is 24 but I think I might allow this to be an input field so you can choose as many as you like.
